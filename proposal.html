            </header>
            <p>
            Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest 
            (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?")     
            </p>
            <p>
            Identify an information technology problem in that space 
            (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
            </p>
            <p>
            Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem 
            (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")  
            </p>

                <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
            Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? 
            What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
            </p>
            <p>
            What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? 
            Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; 
            be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! 
            </p>
            <p>
            What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use data from an external source 
            (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
            </p>
            <p>
            How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
