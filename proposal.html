                <h2>Proposed Description</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The issue of racial discrimination faced by Asians in the United States is a complex and serious topic. 
            Despite advancements and successes in certain areas within the Asian community, 
            they still frequently encounter various forms of discrimination and prejudice.
            </p>
            <p>
            An information technology problem related to the issue of racial discrimination faced by Asians in 
            the United States could be the lack of comprehensive data collection and analysis on discrimination 
            incidents specifically targeting the Asian community.
            </p>
            <p>One previous attempt to address the issue of racial discrimination faced by Asians in the United States is the development 
            and use of online reporting platforms and apps specifically focused on hate crimes and discrimination incidents.

                <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
            Individuals who have experienced or witnessed incidents of racial discrimination, hate speech, harassment, 
            or violence targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. This feature allows users to report incidents of racial discrimination, hate speech, harassment, 
            or violence targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. Users can provide detailed information about the incident, 
            including the type of discrimination, location, date, time, and any supporting evidence such as photos, videos, or witness statements. 
            The app should provide a user-friendly interface with form fields, file upload options, and clear instructions for submitting reports.
            </p>
            <p>
            The web app plays a crucial role in addressing racial discrimination by providing a platform for reporting, documenting, analyzing, 
            and responding to discrimination incidents. It leverages technology to empower individuals, build community resilience, drive social change, 
            and promote a more inclusive and equitable society. The app allows victims and witnesses to document and report incidents in detail, 
            including the nature of the discrimination, location, time, and any supporting evidence. This data collection is 
            crucial for understanding the scope and nature of the problem, identifying trends, and assessing the impact on 
            affected communities.
